# awsiot

I am new to Python. This is my pilot python project to explore AWS ioT

Following things are required to run this code 

1. Raspberry Pi Model B
2. AWS Free Account - IoT configuration

WiFi Scanner Using Raspberry Pi and Python
==========================================

This is a python application that runs on your RaspberryPi device that can monitor the devices connected on Home WiFi. You can verify the list and figure out the unauthorized access. The WiFi scanner output will be pushed to AWS IoT and you can do the analysis on your device data using the AWS Lambda function.
